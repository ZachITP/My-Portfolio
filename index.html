  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> My Name is Zach Hanson. I am a proud husband and Father of two beautiful kids Emery 4, and Casen Maverick 7 months. 
    While I have some experience with computers my passion so far has been photography. 
    I have done everything from nature, wildlife, portrait, and sports photography all while on a mission to capture the world in a unique way that most people have never seen before. 
    Recently I was presented with an opportunity to work for an IT company and dive into the app development and coding world. 
    It has been a great experience so far and even led me to get formal training at UTSA in their Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. 
    The projects that are contained in this portfolio are some examples of everything that I have learned up until this point.  </p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>When you first dive into the coding world the first thing you learn is HTML and CSS. For this project I used these tools to create a cheat sheet for beginners.
      In this link you will find basic information about HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript which will help you understand the fundementals to catapult you forward.
